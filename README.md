# GameOfLife-TanterColin-CDOF4

Open Source Project - A Node.js implementation of Conway's **Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway.

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the **Game of Life** project locally, contribute to its development, and deploy it.

---

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)
- **Git** (for version control)

To install Node.js, follow the steps on:
https://nodejs.org/fr/download

npm will be automatically installed

To check if these are installed:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

---

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colin03ttr/GameOfLife-TanterColin-CDOF4.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GameOfLife-TanterColin-CDOF4
   cd gameoflife
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
---

### Running the Game

Once started, the **Game of Life** will run a simulation based on an initial configuration of cells. The game can be customized through the configuration file or user inputs (details provided in the documentation).

---


### Testing Details

- **End-to-end Tests**: Verify the simulation lifecycle of the Game of Life.
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on smaller components like grid initialization and rule implementation.

---

## Deployment

To deploy the **Game of Life** on a live system:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. Use a Node.js-compatible server or hosting service to serve the application.
